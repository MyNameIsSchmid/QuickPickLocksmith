            <p>Whether you've just moved in, you've lost a key, or just want to feel safer, you can rekey your locks so that they work with a different key than before. If done uncorrectly, this process could lead to many issues like "sticky" locks or nonfunctional keys. However we make sure to take the time and care to make sure your lock works even better than how we found it!</p>
            <p>To rekey your house, our trained professional will come and make a plan with you for what locks you want rekeyed, what key you want them to match, and how long the job should take (usually around 15 minutes per lock). They will then remove the locks, take them apart, and replace the current key-pins with ones that will match your new key. Once putting everything back together, the trained professional will then reinstall the newly rekeyed lock back on the door and make sure that everything is working perfectly.</p>
